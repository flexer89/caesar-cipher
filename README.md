## Caesar Cipher

# Description

Caesar Cipher is a method in which each letter in the plain text is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

Initially, user has to pick between encryption and decryption
Then user inputs a text and a shift number and gets a program result


# Example Input

```
